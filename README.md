Official pytorch implementation of [Grounding DINO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05499). Code will be available soon!

## Highlight
- SOTA Closed-Set Detection Model [DINO](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/DINO) => SOTA Open-Set Detection Model **Grounding DINO**
- Pure Transformer-based. 
- COCO zero-shot **52.5 AP** (training without COCO data!). COCO fine-tune **63.0 AP**.

# Links
Our model is related to [DINO](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/DINO) and [GLIP](https://github.com/microsoft/GLIP). Thanks for their great work!

We also thank great previous work including DETR, Deformable DETR, SMCA, Conditional DETR, Anchor DETR, Dynamic DETR, DAB-DETR, DN-DETR, etc. More related work are available at [Awesome Detection Transformer](https://github.com/IDEACVR/awesome-detection-transformer). A new toolbox [detrex](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/detrex) is available as well.
