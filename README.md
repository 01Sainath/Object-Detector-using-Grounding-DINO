Official pytorch implementation of [Grounding DINO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05499). Code will be available soon!

## Highlight
- **Open-Set Detection.** Detect **everything** with language!
- **High Performancce.** COCO zero-shot **52.5 AP** (training without COCO data!). COCO fine-tune **63.0 AP**.
- **Flexible.** Collaboration with Stable Diffusion for Image Editting.
